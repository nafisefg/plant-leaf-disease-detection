# plant-leaf-disease-detection
A machine learning project for detecting plant leaf diseases using SVM classification

## Overview

This project detects leaf diseases using a pipeline that includes:

- Image loading and preprocessing
- Segmentation using KMeans
- Selecting infected segments
- Feature extraction from segments
- Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The model was trained and evaluated using labeled image data, achieving a test accuracy of 85.71%.
